## Title
HandReceipt: Blockchain Supply Chain Management

## Subtitle
Transforming Military and Commercial Inventory Management

## Visual Elements
- **Company Logo**: Place the HandReceipt logo prominently at the center-top of the slide
- **Background**: Clean, professional design with a subtle blockchain visual element (connecting nodes or blocks in very light opacity)
- **Color Scheme**: Primary brand colors with high contrast for readability
- **Optional Footer**: Presenter name and title in smaller font at the bottom

## Design Notes
- Keep the design minimal and impactful
- Ensure the logo and title have sufficient white space around them
- The blockchain visual elements should be subtle and not distract from the main content
- Use a professional, modern font that conveys technology leadership

## Key Impression
This slide should convey professionalism, technological innovation, and the dual-market focus (military and commercial applications).

## Presenter Notes
- Begin with a brief (5-10 second) pause after the slide appears to allow the audience to read the title
- Start with a powerful opening statement that encapsulates HandReceipt's value proposition
- Example: "HandReceipt is transforming how organizations manage their supply chains by bringing military-grade accountability to commercial markets, and modern blockchain efficiency to military logistics."
- Keep the introduction brief (30-45 seconds) before moving to the problem statement slide
