# Slide 2: The Broken Link in Supply Chains

## Title
The Broken Link in Supply Chains

## Visual Elements
- **Split Screen Layout**: Divided into military (left) and commercial (right) sections
- **Military Visual**: Officer surrounded by paper forms with a frustrated expression
- **Commercial Visual**: Warehouse manager dealing with payment delays and supplier issues
- **Pain Point Icons**: Small icons representing each key challenge mentioned

## Key Points

### Military Challenges:
- Paper-based accountability systems requiring manual signatures
- Time-consuming manual inventories (8+ hours per week per unit)
- High liability risk for lost/misplaced equipment ($100K+ per incident)
- Limited visibility across supply chain (72+ hour delays in status updates)

### Commercial Challenges:
- Extended payment cycles (60-90 days) creating cash flow problems
- Limited visibility into multi-tier supplier networks
- Expensive ERP systems ($250K+ implementation costs)
- Data silos between departments and locations

## Design Notes
- Use contrasting but complementary colors for military and commercial sections
- Include small data visualizations showing time and cost impacts
- Consider adding brief customer quotes or statistics to emphasize pain points
- Use icons consistently to represent each key problem

## Key Impression
This slide should create a clear understanding of the significant problems that exist in both military and commercial supply chains, establishing the need that HandReceipt addresses.

## Presenter Notes
- Begin with the statement: "Supply chain management today is broken in both military and commercial sectors."
- Emphasize the personal impact: "For military officers, this means hours of paperwork and personal liability. For commercial managers, this means cash flow challenges and visibility gaps."
- Use specific examples to make the problems relatable and concrete
- Transition to the solution slide by noting: "These aren't just inconveniencesâ€”they represent millions in inefficiency and risk that HandReceipt directly addresses."
