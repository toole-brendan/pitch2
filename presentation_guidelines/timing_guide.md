## Timing Management Tips

1. **Practice extensively**: Time yourself during rehearsals to ensure consistent pacing
2. **Create internal milestones**: Note the time you should be at specific slides
3. **Have a timer visible**: Position a clock or timer where you can see it without being obvious
4. **Develop timing cues**: Mark specific points in your notes for time checks
5. **Be prepared to adjust**: Know which content can be condensed if running long
6. **Avoid common time traps**:
   - Too much technical detail on slides 3, 11, and 12
   - Over-explaining the market on slides 5 and 6
   - Delving too deeply into product features on slides 7-10

## Adjusting for Different Audience Types

### For VC Audiences
- Spend more time on market size (slides 5-6) and financial projections (slide 19)
- Reduce time on technical details (slide 12)

### For Strategic Partners
- Allocate more time to competitive positioning (slide 15) and roadmap (slide 17)
- Spend less time on team credentials (slide 18)

### For Military Decision Makers
- Dedicate more time to defense solution (slides 7-8)
- Expand on security features in the technology section (slide 12)
- Reduce time on commercial applications (slides 9-10)

## Managing Q&A Time

- Reserve at least 15 minutes for Q&A
- Direct technical questions to appropriate team members
- Use appendix slides for detailed explanations
- If a question requires a lengthy answer, offer to follow up after the presentation
- Always bring answers back to business impact and investor returns
